This website requires express, ejs, bodyparser, mysql, cookieparser

Do note, as requested "list posts" is a feature, it's in the "topics" portion. There is a universal post search option too.

use the dump.sql file to create the data and database although the other .sql files should work the dump.sql is far more consistent, especially across servers and ide's

dump.sql contains both the database and data, I am aware this would usually be a big no-no, however, all data is for test purposes and commercial versions will not contain this file.
